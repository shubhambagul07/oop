Here’s a line-by-line explanation of the code from `Publication.java`, `Book.java`, `Magazine.java`, and `Main.java`:

### **Publication.java** (Base class for common publication attributes and methods)

1. **`public class Publication {`**

   * Declares the `Publication` class, which is the base class for all types of publications like books and magazines.

2. **`protected String title;`**

   * Declares a `String` variable `title` that will store the title of the publication. It's `protected`, meaning it can be accessed by classes that inherit from `Publication`.

3. **`protected double price;`**

   * Declares a `double` variable `price` that will store the price of the publication. It's also `protected`.

4. **`protected int copies;`**

   * Declares an `int` variable `copies` to store the number of copies sold or ordered for the publication. It's `protected`.

5. **`public void setData(String title, double price) {`**

   * This is a method that sets the `title` and `price` for the publication using the values passed as arguments.

6. **`this.title = title;`**

   * Sets the `title` of the publication to the `title` passed as an argument.

7. **`this.price = price;`**

   * Sets the `price` of the publication to the `price` passed as an argument.

8. **`}`**

   * Closes the `setData` method.

9. **`public void saleCopy(int qty) {`**

   * This method handles the sale of copies. It increases the number of copies sold and calculates the total sale amount.

10. **`copies += qty;`**

    * Increases the number of copies by the quantity sold (`qty`).

11. **`double saleAmount = qty * price;`**

    * Calculates the total sale amount by multiplying the quantity sold (`qty`) by the price of the publication (`price`).

12. **`System.out.println("Sold " + qty + " copies of \"" + title + "\". Total sale: ₹" + saleAmount);`**

    * Prints a message saying how many copies were sold and the total sale amount for that sale.

13. **`}`**

    * Closes the `saleCopy` method.

14. **`public double getTotalSale() {`**

    * This method returns the total sales of the publication, calculated as the number of copies sold (`copies`) multiplied by the price (`price`).

15. **`return copies * price;`**

    * Returns the total sale amount for the publication.

16. **`}`**

   * This method sets the details of the book: its `title`, `price`, and `author`.

4. **`setData(title, price);`**

   * Calls the `setData` method from the `Publication` class to set the `title` and `price` of the book.

5. **`this.author = author;`**

   * Sets the `author` of the book to the value passed as an argument.

6. **`}`**

   * Closes the `setBookDetails` method.

7. **`public void orderCopies(int qty) {`**

   * This method orders a specific quantity of book copies by calling the `saleCopy` method (inherited from `Publication`).

8. **`saleCopy(qty);`**

   * Calls the `saleCopy` method from `Publication` to handle the sale of the ordered book copies.

9. **`}`**

   * Closes the `orderCopies` method.

10. **`}`**

    * Closes the `Book` class.

### **Magazine.java** (Inherits from `Publication`, specific to magazines)

1. **`public class Magazine extends Publication {`**

   * Declares the `Magazine` class, which inherits from `Publication`. This class will have attributes and methods related specifically to magazines.

2. **`private String currentIssue;`**

   * Declares a `String` variable `currentIssue` to store the current issue of the magazine (e.g., "May 2025").

3. **`public void setMagazineDetails(String title, double price, String issue) {`**

   * This method sets the details of the magazine: its `title`, `price`, and `currentIssue`.

4. **`setData(title, price);`**

   * Calls the `setData` method from the `Publication` class to set the `title` and `price` of the magazine.

5. **`this.currentIssue = issue;`**

   * Sets the `currentIssue` of the magazine to the value passed as an argument.

6. **`}`**

   * Closes the `setMagazineDetails` method.

7. **`public void orderQty(int qty) {`**

   * This method orders a specific quantity of magazine copies by calling the `saleCopy` method (inherited from `Publication`).

8. **`saleCopy(qty);`**

   * Calls the `saleCopy` method from `Publication` to handle the sale of the ordered magazine copies.

9. **`}`**

   * Closes the `orderQty` method.

10. **`public void receiveIssue(String issue) {`**

    * This method sets the magazine's `currentIssue` to a new value (e.g., receiving the next issue).

11. **`this.currentIssue = issue;`**

    * Sets the `currentIssue` to the new issue passed as an argument.

12. **`System.out.println("Received new issue: " + currentIssue);`**

    * Prints a message saying which new issue of the magazine was received.

13. **`}`**

### **Main.java** (The class that runs the program)

1. **`public class Main {`**

   * Declares the `Main` class, which is where the program execution starts.

2. **`public static void main(String[] args) {`**

   * This is the entry point of the program. The code inside this method is executed when the program runs.

3. **`Book b1 = new Book();`**

   * Creates a new `Book` object called `b1`.

4. **`b1.setBookDetails("Java Programming", 450, "John Smith");`**

5. **`b1.orderCopies(10);`**

   * Orders 10 copies of the book by calling the `orderCopies` method, which internally calls `saleCopy` to handle the sale.

6. **`Magazine m1 = new Magazine();`**

   * Creates a new `Magazine` object called `m1`.

7. **`m1.setMagazineDetails("Tech Monthly", 80, "May 2025");`**

10. **`double totalSale = b1.getTotalSale() + m1.getTotalSale();`**

    * Calculates the total sale amount by adding the total sales of the book (`b1.getTotalSale()`) and the magazine (`m1.getTotalSale()`).

11. **`System.out.println("Total sale of all publications: ₹" + totalSale);`**

    * Prints the total sales amount of all publications.

In summary:

* `Publication.java` is a base class for common properties of publications (title, price, copies).
* `Book.java` and `Magazine.java` extend `Publication` and add specific features for books and magazines.
* `Main.java` demonstrates how to create and use books and magazines, handle sales, and calculate total sales.

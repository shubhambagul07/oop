Let’s break down the code step by step in simple terms:

### **1. Vehicle Interface**

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void gearChange(int gear);  // Change gear
    void speedUp(int increment); // Speed up the vehicle
    void applyBrakes(int decrement); // Apply brakes
}
```

* **`Vehicle`** is an **interface** that declares common behaviors (methods) that all types of vehicles should implement.

  * `gearChange(int gear)`: Method to change the gear of the vehicle.
  * `speedUp(int increment)`: Method to increase the vehicle's speed.
  * `applyBrakes(int decrement)`: Method to decrease the vehicle's speed.

### **2. Bicycle Class**

```java
class Bicycle implements Vehicle {
    private int speed;
    private int gear;
```

* `Bicycle` is a **class** that **implements** the `Vehicle` interface, which means it must provide definitions for all the methods declared in `Vehicle`.
* It has two **private variables**: `speed` (the speed of the bicycle) and `gear` (the gear of the bicycle).

```java
    public Bicycle() {
        speed = 0;
        gear = 1;
    }
```

* The constructor **`Bicycle()`** initializes the bicycle's speed to 0 and the gear to 1 when a new `Bicycle` object is created.

```java
    @Override
    public void gearChange(int gear) {
        this.gear = gear;
        System.out.println("Bicycle gear changed to: " + gear);
    }
```

* **`gearChange(int gear)`**: This method sets the bicycle’s gear to the provided value and prints a message showing the new gear.

```java
    @Override
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
        System.out.println("Bicycle speed increased to: " + speed + " km/h");
    }
```

* **`speedUp(int increment)`**: This method increases the bicycle's speed by the given increment and prints the new speed.

```java
    @Override
    public void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
        if (speed < 0) speed = 0;
        System.out.println("Bicycle speed decreased to: " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}
```

* **`applyBrakes(int decrement)`**: This method decreases the bicycle's speed by the given decrement. If the speed goes below 0, it sets the speed to 0. It then prints the new speed.

### **3. Bike Class**

```java
class Bike implements Vehicle {
    private int speed;
    private int gear;
```

* The `Bike` class also **implements** the `Vehicle` interface, so it must provide the same methods (`gearChange`, `speedUp`, `applyBrakes`) but with its own implementation.

```java
    public Bike() {
        speed = 0;
        gear = 1;
    }
```

* The constructor **`Bike()`** initializes the bike’s speed to 0 and gear to 1.

```java
    @Override
    public void gearChange(int gear) {
        this.gear = gear;
        System.out.println("Bike gear changed to: " + gear);
    }

    @Override
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
        System.out.println("Bike speed increased to: " + speed + " km/h");
    }

    @Override
    public void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
        if (speed < 0) speed = 0;
        System.out.println("Bike speed decreased to: " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}
```

* These methods work exactly the same as for the `Bicycle`, changing the gear, increasing the speed, and applying brakes to decrease the speed.

### **4. Car Class**

```java
class Car implements Vehicle {
    private int speed;
    private int gear;
```

* The `Car` class is another implementation of the `Vehicle` interface with its own versions of the methods.

```java
    public Car() {
        speed = 0;
        gear = 1;
    }
```

* The constructor **`Car()`** initializes the car's speed to 0 and gear to 1.

```java
    @Override
    public void gearChange(int gear) {
        this.gear = gear;
        System.out.println("Car gear changed to: " + gear);
    }

    @Override
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
        System.out.println("Car speed increased to: " + speed + " km/h");
    }

    @Override
    public void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
        if (speed < 0) speed = 0;
        System.out.println("Car speed decreased to: " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}
```

* Just like the `Bicycle` and `Bike`, these methods modify the speed and gear for the `Car` object.

### **5. Main Class**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle bicycle = new Bicycle();
        Vehicle bike = new Bike();
        Vehicle car = new Car();
```

* This is the **`Main`** class, where the program starts.
* It creates three objects:

  * `bicycle`: A `Bicycle` object.
  * `bike`: A `Bike` object.
  * `car`: A `Car` object.
* All three objects are created using the `Vehicle` interface as their reference type. This is **polymorphism**: the same reference type (`Vehicle`) can hold objects of different types (e.g., `Bicycle`, `Bike`, `Car`).

```java
        bicycle.gearChange(3);
        bicycle.speedUp(15);
        bicycle.applyBrakes(5);
```

* These lines **test the functionality of the bicycle**:

  * Change the gear to 3.
  * Increase speed by 15 km/h.
  * Apply brakes to decrease speed by 5 km/h.

```java
        bike.gearChange(4);
        bike.speedUp(30);
        bike.applyBrakes(10);
```

* These lines **test the functionality of the bike** with similar operations as for the bicycle.

```java
        car.gearChange(5);
        car.speedUp(50);
        car.applyBrakes(20);
    }
}
```

* These lines **test the functionality of the car** with similar operations as for the bicycle and bike.

### **Summary**

* **`Vehicle` Interface**: Defines methods that all vehicles must implement.
* **`Bicycle`, `Bike`, and `Car`**: Classes that implement the `Vehicle` interface and provide specific functionality for changing gears, speeding up, and applying brakes.
* **`Main` Class**: Creates instances of the `Bicycle`, `Bike`, and `Car`, and demonstrates the use of the methods defined in the `Vehicle` interface.

This demonstrates **interface implementation**, **polymorphism**, and **method overriding** in Java.
